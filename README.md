https://www.you-go.world/ is a final project of the LeWagon Web Development bootcamp in collaboration with a project team from the Data Science batch. 

**Concept**: The website aggregates sport experiences from different platforms and sources in the world wide web. To create a MVP version, we accessed the Meetup API, extracted relevant events for different sport disciplines and integrated the API information in our own layout.

Implemented functionalities: 
- Login with personal dashboard including profile, wishlist, messaging and bookings
- Map integration via mapbox and geocoding of the sport event locations
- Search functionality based on keyword and location
- Wishlist functionality with AJAX
- Booking of events that were created on the platform directly
- Messages for events that were created on the platform directly

**Data Science Collaboration:** We collaborated with the Data Science students for 2 functionalities, (1) getting the event data from the Meetup GraphQL API and (2) including recommendations based on user activity/history.
